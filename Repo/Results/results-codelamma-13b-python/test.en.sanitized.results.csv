Write a python function to check whether the given array is monotonic or not.

A monotonic array is an array that is either increasing or decreasing.

An array A is increasing if A[i] <= A[i+1] holds for every i.

An array A is decreasing if A[i] >= A[i+1] holds for every i.

Return 1 if the given array is monotonic, else return 0.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, which denotes the size of the array.

The second line contains N integers, which denote the elements of the array A.

Output Format

Print 1 if the given array is monotonic, else print 0.

Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.

The babylonian method is a way to approximate the square root of a number.

The babylonian method is a method of finding the square root of a number by successive approximation.

The idea is that if you have a guess x for the square root of a number n, then the average of x and n/x is a better approximation.

The average of two numbers is the sum of the two numbers divided by two.

The babylonian method is:

1. Start with a guess for the square root.

2. Take the average of that guess and the original number divided by the guess.

<</SYS>>

Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.

The function should return a list of tuples, each containing a pair of factors.

The number of factors returned will be equal to the number specified in the argument.

If there are not enough factors in the lists, the returned list should contain the maximum number of factors possible.

The returned list should be sorted by the product of the two factors, in descending order.

If there are factors with the same product, they should be returned in the order found in the lists.

The lists will contain positive or negative integers.

Examples:

largest_product([1, 2, 3], [1, 2"
