```python

This function takes a string `s` and a character `c` as input, and returns a new string that is the same as the original string, but with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed.

The function uses the `index()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of `c` in the string, and the `rindex()` method to find the index of the last occurrence. The function then returns a new string that is a slice of the original string, starting from one position after the first occurrence of `c` and ending before the last occurrence.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:

```python

Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.

Here is a possible solution:

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Calculate the sum of each row
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in matrix]

    # Sort the matrix based on the calculated row sums
    matrix.sort(key=row_sums.__getitem__)

    return matrix
```

This function first calculates the sum of each row in the given matrix and stores them in a list called `row_sums`. Then, it sorts the matrix based on the `row_sums` list using the `sort()` function with the `key` parameter set to `row_sums.__getitem__`. The `__getitem__` method is a special method in Python that allows us to access elements of an object by index.

Here is an example usage of the function:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8,"

This function checks if the input string `s` contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore. It first generates all possible combinations of two consecutive characters in the string, sorts them, and removes duplicates. Then, it checks if the sorted sequence of characters forms a valid sequence with an underscore by checking if the characters are in sorted order and if the sequence is longer than one character. Finally, it checks if any of these valid sequences are found in the input string using the `any()` function and the `find()` method.

This function takes a single argument `side_length`, which represents the length of each side of the square. It then multiplies this value by 4 to calculate the perimeter of the square and returns the result.

You can call this function with a specific side length to get the perimeter of the square:

```python
perimeter = square_perimeter(5)
print(perimeter)  # Output: 20

        if num in seen:

This function iterates through the array and checks if each element is already in the dictionary. If it is, it returns `True`, indicating that there is a duplicate. If the element is not found in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. If all elements have been iterated through and no duplicates were found, the function returns `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since the dictionary stores all unique elements.

```python

Here is a simple Python function that finds the closest smaller number than a given number `n`. This function uses the built-in Python function `next()` to iterate through the numbers and find the closest smaller number.

```python
def closest_smaller(n):
    smaller_numbers = sorted(range(1, n + 1))

```

This function first sorts the numbers from 1 to `n` and then uses a generator expression to iterate through the sorted numbers. The `next()` function is used to find the first number that is greater than `n`.

You can test this function with the following examples:

```python
print(closest_smaller(5))  # Output: 4
print(closest_smaller(10))  # Output: 9
print(closest_smaller(1))  # Output: 1

This function works by splitting the given sentence into a list of words, initializing a variable `max_length` to 0, and then iterating through each word in the list. If the length of the current word is greater than the current value of `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of the current word. Finally, the function returns the value of `max_length`, which represents the length of the longest word in the sentence.

You can test this function with the following example:

```python

This function iterates through the list of strings and checks if the given substring is present in each string. If it finds a match, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find any match, it returns `False`.

You can use this function like this:

```python
strings = [""hello world"", ""hello there"", ""world hello""]
substring = ""hello""

Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.

An undulating number is a number that has the same number of digits in each group of consecutive digits from left to right, and the groups are separated by a comma.

For example, the number 123,456,789 is undulating because it has 3 groups of 3 digits each.

The number 123,45,678 is not undulating because it has 3 groups, but the first group has 3 digits and the second and third groups have 4 digits.

Given a list of tuples, write a function that returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.

Here is a possible solution:

```python
def min_second(lst):
    return [x[0] for x in lst if x[1] == min(x[1] for x in lst)]

# Example usage:
tuples = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
print(min_second(tuples))  # Output: [1, 3]
```

In this solution, we first find the minimum second value in the list of tuples using the built-in `min()` function. Then, we use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the first values of the tuples that have the minimum second value. The resulting list is returned by the function.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of tuples in the input list. This is because we only iterate through the list once to find the minimum second"

                smallest_length = len(sublist)
        return smallest_length
```

This function takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the length of the smallest list in the list. If the input list is empty, it returns `None`.

The function initializes the `smallest_length` variable with the length of the first list in the input list. Then, it iterates through the rest of the lists in the input list and updates the `smallest_length` variable if it finds a list with a smaller length. Finally, it returns the `smallest_length` variable.

This function works by iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n` and checking if the current number is a divisor of `n` (i.e., if `n` modulo the current number is 0). If it is, the count is incremented. The function returns the final count of divisors.

    return sum(lst) ",[],"['assert count([True,False,True]) == 2', 'assert count([False,False]) == 0', 'assert count([True,True,True]) == 3']","1.

Write a Python function to count true booleans in the given list.

Here is a sample code:

```python
def count_true(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in lst:
        if i is True:
            count += 1
    return count

This function iterates through the list and checks if each element is equal to the boolean value `True`. If it is, it increments the count variable. Finally, it returns the count variable.

2.

Additional Keywords:

* `enumerate()`: A built-in function that allows you to loop through a list with both the index and the value of each element.

Here is a sample code using `enumerate()`:

```python
def count_true(lst):
    count = 0
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if value is True:
            count += 1

Here is a sample code:

```python
def append_list_to_tuples(lst, tuples):
    for tpl in tuples:
        tpl += lst

This function takes a list and a list of tuples as arguments, and appends the list to each tuple in the list of tuples.

Example usage:

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
tuples = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9)]

2.

```python
def merge_lists(list1, list2, list3):

This function uses the unpacking operator (`*`) to concatenate the three input lists and then sorts the resulting list in ascending order.

Both functions achieve the same goal and are equivalent in terms of functionality. The second function is slightly more concise and easier to read due to the use of the unpacking operator. However, the choice between the two functions ultimately depends on personal preference and coding style."

Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.

Here is a simple solution using a dictionary to count the frequency of each item in the list, and then finding the item with the maximum count.

```python
def max_frequency(lst):
    freq_dict = {}
    max_freq = 0
    max_item = None

    for item in lst:
        if item in freq_dict:

            max_freq = freq_dict[item]
            max_item = item

    return max_item
```

This function works by initializing an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each item, and a variable `max_freq` to store the maximum frequency found so far. It then iterates through the list, incrementing the count for each item in the dictionary and updating `max_freq` and `max_item` as necessary."

This function first creates a set of vowels and then finds the indices of the vowels in the input string `s`. It then reverses the indices of the vowels and uses them to create a new list of vowels in reverse order. Finally, it joins the reversed vowels together and replaces the original vowels in the string with the reversed vowels to get the final result.

def ratio_of_zeroes(arr):

This function iterates through the array, counting the number of zeroes and non-zeroes. It then returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes as a float. If there are no non-zeroes in the array, it returns 0 to avoid a division by zero error.

This function first checks if the number is non-negative, as the representation of a negative number as the sum of non-zero powers of 2 is not possible. Then it generates a list of powers of 2 up to the bit length of the number. Finally, it checks if the length of the set of powers is equal to the number. This means that each power of 2 is included in the set exactly once, and the sum of these powers is equal to the number.

Write a Python function to set all even bits of a given number.

Here is a possible solution:

This function uses recursion to generate all combinations of length `n` from the input list `lst`. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the function yields an empty list (which represents a combination of no elements). For any other value of `n`, the function iterates over the elements of the list, and for each element, it generates all combinations of the remaining elements of the list of length `n-1` (by recursively calling the `combinations` function), and yields a new combination that includes the current element and the combination generated by the recursive"

This function works by simply swapping the positions of the two numbers in a tuple. The tuple data structure is a built-in data type in Python that allows you to group multiple values together in a single variable. Tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This makes them useful for storing data that should not be modified.

Here is a simple implementation of the function to find the n'th star number using recursion:

This function calculates the n'th star number by summing up the previous three star numbers (n-1, n-2, n-3). The base case is when n is 0, in which case the function returns 1.

Note that this function has an exponential time complexity due to the recursive calls, and it may not be suitable for large values of n. A more efficient implementation using dynamic programming can be found below:

Write a Python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list.

Here is a sample list:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The function should return the sum of the even numbers at even positions, which is 4 + 8 = 12.

Here is the Python code for the function:

```
def sum_even_at_even(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += numbers[i]
    return sum
```

This function works by iterating through the list and checking if the index `i` is even and the number at that index is also even. If both conditions are met, the number is added to the sum. The final sum is then returned.

You can test the function with the sample list as follows:

This function takes in an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power. It does this by iterating through the range of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), multiplying each number by 2 to get the even number, raising that number to the fifth power, and adding the result to a running total. Finally, it returns the total sum.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

* `total` is initialized to 0. This will be used to store the sum of the even numbers raised to the fifth power.
* The `for` loop iterates through the range of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
* For each number `i` in the range, the function calculates the even number by multiplying `2 * i`.
* The function raises the even number to the fifth"

Here's a simple function that extracts the colon from a tuple, if it exists. If the tuple doesn't contain a colon, the function returns an empty string.

```python
def get_colon(tuple_):
    if ':' in tuple_:
        return tuple_.index(':')
    else:

This function uses the `index()` method to find the position of the colon in the tuple. If the colon is not found, it returns an empty string.

2. Additional Keywords:

* `enumerate()`: A built-in function that adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object.
* `split()`: A string method that splits a string into a list where each word is a list item.

Here's an example of using `enumerate()` and `split()` to extract the colon from a string:

Here is a simple solution using bitwise operations:

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):

```

This function takes a number as an argument and returns the same number with the left most unset bit set. The bitwise OR operation (`|`) sets the bit at the position where at least one of the corresponding bits in the two operands is set. Since we are ORing the number with 1, the left most unset bit will be set to 1.

Here is an example usage:

```python
>>> set_left_most_unset_bit(5)
6
```

In this example, the number 5 has all its bits set, so the left most unset bit is the first bit (0th index). The function returns the number 6, which has the first bit set to 1 and the rest of the bits unchanged.

Note that this function will not work correctly if the number passed as an argument has all its bits set"

Write a function to perform the mathematical bitwise xor operation across the given tuples.

Here's a possible solution:

```python
def bitwise_xor(tuples):
    result = 0
    for t in tuples:
        result ^= t
    return result
```

This function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains integers. It initializes a variable `result` to 0, then iterates through each tuple in the input list. For each tuple, it performs the bitwise xor operation between the `result` and the tuple, and updates the `result` with the new value. Finally, it returns the `result`.

Example usage:

```python
tuples = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]
print(bitwise_xor(tuples))  # Output: 15
```

In this example, the bitwise xor operation is performed on the numbers in each tuple, and the results are combined to produce"

This function uses the built-in `set()` function to create a set from the input list. Since sets only allow unique elements, the length of the set is equal to the number of unique tuples in the input list. This function is more concise than the previous one, but it may be less clear to beginners."

If it is, the maximum length and the maximum element are updated accordingly. Finally, the function returns the maximum element.

You can test this function with the following example:

```python
lst = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test']
print(max_length_element(lst))
```

This will output: `'hello'` as it has the maximum length of 5 characters in the given list."

```python
def sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):
    sorted_dict = dict(sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
    return sorted_dict
```

This function takes a dictionary as an argument, sorts its items based on their values using the `sorted()` function, and returns a new dictionary with the sorted items. The `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function is a function that takes an item (a tuple of key and value) and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, we use the second element of the tuple (the value) for sorting.

You can use this function like this:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
sorted_dict = sort_dict_by_value("

Write a Python function to find the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array.

Here is a simple solution using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions in Python:

```python
def sum_of_extremes(arr):
    return max(arr) + min(arr)
```

This function takes an array as an argument, finds the maximum and minimum values using the `max()` and `min()` functions, and returns their sum.

You can test this function with the following example:

```python
arr = [5, 3, 8, 1, 6]
print(sum_of_extremes(arr))  # Output: 14
```

2.

Write a Python function to find the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array, but without using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions.

Here is a solution using two variables to store the minimum and maximum values:

```python
def sum_of_extremes(arr"

  return (string.lower())",[],"['assert is_lower(""InValid"") == ""invalid""', 'assert is_lower(""TruE"") == ""true""', 'assert is_lower(""SenTenCE"") == ""sentence""']","\nHere is the function to convert the given string to lower case in Python:\n\n```python\ndef to_lowercase(string):\n return string.lower()```

This function uses the `lower()` method of the string object to convert the given string to lower case. The `lower()` method returns a copy of the string with all the uppercase letters converted to lowercase.

You can use this function like this:
```python
my_string = ""HELLO WORLD""
lower_string = to_lowercase(my_string)
print(lower_string)
```

This will output:
```
hello world
```

You can also use the `lower()` method directly on the string object without defining a separate function like this:
```python
my_string = ""HELLO WORLD""
lower_string = my_string.lower()
print(lower_string)
```

Both methods will give the same output."

 return re.sub('[a-z]', '', str1)",[],"['assert remove_lowercase(""PYTHon"")==(\'PYTH\')', 'assert remove_lowercase(""FInD"")==(\'FID\')', 'assert remove_lowercase(""STRinG"")==(\'STRG\')']","1.

Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.

Here's a possible solution:

```python
def remove_lowercase(s):
    result = """"
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result
```

This function iterates through each character in the input string `s`. If the character is uppercase, it is added to the result string. If the character is lowercase, it is ignored. The function returns the result string.

Example usage:

```python
print(remove_lowercase(""HelloWorld""))  # Output: ""HW""
```

2.

Write a function to remove all substrings that are not in a given list of words from a given string.

Here's a possible solution:

```python
def remove_not_in_list(s, words):
    result = """"
    for word in words:
        while word in s:
            s = s.replace(word, """", 1)
    return s
```"

    return int(n) ",[],"['assert first_Digit(123) == 1', 'assert first_Digit(456) == 4', 'assert first_Digit(12) == 1']","1.

Here is a Python function to find the first digit of a given number:

```python
def find_first_digit(n):
    if n < 10:
        return n
    else:
        return find_first_digit(n // 10)
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 until it reaches a single digit. The base case is when the number is already a single digit, in which case it returns the number itself.

Example usage:

```python
>>> find_first_digit(12345)
1
>>> find_first_digit(12)
1
>>> find_first_digit(10)
1
>>> find_first_digit(9)
9
```

2.

Here is a Python function to find the last digit of a given number:

```python
def find_last_digit(n):
    if n < 0:
        n = -n
    return n % 10
```
